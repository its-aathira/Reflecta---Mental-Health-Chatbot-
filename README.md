# Reflecta üß† ‚Äî AI-Powered Mental Health Chatbot

Reflecta is a simple yet impactful mental health chatbot that allows users to express their emotions anonymously. It offers thoughtful, AI-generated responses based on user input, making it a safe space for those who hesitate to open up to others.This is just a base moodel of the chatbot with no memory features added an hence we can ask only a single question at a time. We have inlcuded an extra feature called sentiment analyzer that detects the sentiment of the AI responce using VADER Algorithm in the NLTK package.
